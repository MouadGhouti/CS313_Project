# Predicting Online Shoppers' Purchasing Intentions

In this project, I will analyze the Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset to
develop a model that can predict a user's likelihood of purchasing based on their
browsing behavior on a website. This project involves data preprocessing, exploratory
data analysis, predictive modeling, and the interpretation of model outcomes.
